# Glide

Glide is a todo list app inspired by re:zero by Mark Forster.

The mission of this app is to capture the essence and simplicity of re:zero,
while removing some of the friction that comes from using pen and paper.

## Feature List

Here is a (subject to change) list of core features I intend to implement:

- [ ] Add a new task
- [ ] Quickly replace/refine a task
- [ ] Maintain a reference between replacer & replacee tasks
- [ ] Mark a task as complete
- [ ] Mark a task as "zero resistance" or "re:zero"
- [ ] Automatically "un-zero" uncompleted "re:zero" tasks after some interval
- [ ] Enforce reading the whoe list when marking tasks as "re:zero"
- [ ] Task descriptions for adding additional context
